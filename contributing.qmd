## Suggesting edits

The easiest and quickest way to contribute to the book is make suggested edits. On each page you will find a button reading "Edit this page" (usually on the right). 

![Screenshot of a handbook chapter, with a red box on the right hand side of the page indicating where to find the "Edit this page" button](public/Screenshot%202023-12-19%20at%2010.41.49.png)

When you click that, you will immediately be taken to GitHub to edit the text of that specific page. You may be prompted to [create a fork (forking)](#forking) in case these are your first edits.

Once you made your edits, you are ready to commit (save) your changes and [submit your pull request](#submit-a-pull-request), requesting those changes to be included in the handbook.

## Adding a chapter

To add a new chapter, you need to create a new file ending in `.qmd` (e.g., `chapters/example.qmd`). You can do this by visiting the [handbook page on GitHub]({{< meta book.repo-url >}}) and clicking `Add file -> New file`.

When you click this button you may be asked to [fork](#forking) the repository. This is not a problem so go ahead!

The chapter itself needs to be [written in Markdown](#writing-text). Every chapter must contain a first level heading (e.g., `# Heading`), which will be the chapter title. Section headings are second level headings (e.g., `## Section`). 

After that, you are ready to [submit your pull request](#submit-a-pull-request)! The reviewers will help you place the chapter in the right place of the book.[^1]

[^1]: If you are really enthusiastic and want to do it yourself: The chapter needs to be added to the chapters list in `_quarto.yml`. You can find the chapters list around line 24 of that file.

## Submit a pull request 

A pull request is a way to request for your changes to be incorporated into the handbook. This means that the people managing the book will review what you wrote, and accept or decline your contributions. 

## Writing text

The book is created using Markdown - you can get familiarized with the basic syntax on the Markdown website](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). The basics are:

```md
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3

You simply write text as you are used to. To make something *italic*, **bold**, or ***bold and italic***.

> this is how you add quotes

- or lists
- that can go on 
- and on
```

You can utilize more styling of your writing, but these are the basics. If you want to add code, use references, create links, or footnotes - it is all possible. We will expand examples here based on your needs, so if you need help, let us know by reporting an issue!

## GitHub 

We use GitHub to create this website automatically, and to manage all the incoming updates. You do not need to know how it works entirely, but we want to help you understand some things so you are not confused.

### Repository

A repository on GitHub is like a folder on your computer. This can do many things, depending on what files it contains. When we mention a repository, we mean that we want you to look at a specific folder. The repository for this website for example can be found on GitHub directly]({{< meta book.repo-url >}}).

### Forking

A repository is owned by one or multiple people on GitHub. If you are not one of them, you can create a copy to make your edits in. This act of creating a copy is called "forking."
